# Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems

## What is it?

Please write a small Ping CLI application for MacOS or Linux.
The CLI app should accept a hostname or an IP address as its argument, then send ICMP "echo requests" in a loop to the target while receiving "echo reply" messages.
It should report loss and RTT times for each sent message.

Please choose from among these languages: C/C++/Go/Rust

## Requirements

### 1. Use one of the specified languages

Please choose from among C/C++/Go/Rust. If you aren't familiar with these languages, you're not alone! Many engineers join Cloudflare without
specific langauge experience. Please consult [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) or [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html).

### 2. Build a tool with a CLI interface

The tool should accept as a positional terminal argument a hostname or IP address.

### 3. Send ICMP "echo requests" in an infinite loop

As long as the program is running it should continue to emit requests with a periodic delay.

### 4. Report loss and RTT times for each message

Packet loss and latency should be reported as each message received.

## Submitting your project

When submitting your project, you should prepare your code for upload to Greenhouse. The preferred method for doing this is to create a "ZIP archive" of your project folder: for more instructions on how to do this on Windows and Mac, see [this guide](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files/).

Please provide the source code only, a compiled binary is not necessary.

## Extra Credit

1. Add support for both IPv4 and IPv6
2. Allow to set TTL as an argument and report the corresponding "time exceeded‚Äù ICMP messages
3. Any additional features listed in the ping man page or which you think would be valuable
